        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm<strong> Bibek Khadka, </strong>a motivated and detail-oriented IT student and developer based in
            Sydney, Australia.
            I’m currently completing my Bachelor's in Information Technology at Kings Own Institute, with a strong
            interest in system administration, networking, and cybersecurity. I enjoy building user-friendly digital
            solutions and have worked on real-world projects such as the Shade Machine website. My hands-on experience
            includes working with Windows 10 and 11, Windows Server, and Active Directory, as well as using Microsoft
            365 and Azure. I also have practical knowledge of networking basics and troubleshooting, and I'm experienced
            in using ticketing systems to track and resolve IT issues. I take pride in providing friendly and effective
            technical support to users. Passionate about continuous learning, I am currently expanding my skills in
            ethical hacking, system administration, and networking to prepare for a successful career in the IT
            industry.</p>
